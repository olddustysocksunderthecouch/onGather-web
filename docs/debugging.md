# OnGather React Application :: Debugging <!-- omit in toc -->

This application is a standard React application instantiated via create-react-app, and utlises redux.

It is suggested that your debugging tools of choice should therefore be [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=es-419%5D%5D%5D%5D%5D%5D%5D) and [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en), both available on the Chrome web store.
